# Selenium Web Scraper
Given a list of smartphone models, the company wants to know their sales prices in India to support further research on the smartphone market and future decision-making. The list contains thousands of phone models, it can be exhausting to manually check all the sales prices. **So, I developed a web scraping tool built in Python to download phone prices from Google automatically.**  <br>
<br>
The Python program will input each model name into Google search box, run the search and extract the price from searching results. All the work is done by running one Python function. <br>
<br>
The technologies behind this tool are controlling web browser with Selenium and parsing web data with BeautifulSoup.
